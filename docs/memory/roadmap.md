## Current Priority Queue

### 🐛 Bug Fixes (Priority)

| Status | Item | Description | Priority |
|--------|------|-------------|----------|
| ✅ | **Execution Queue Race Conditions** | **Fixed 2026-01-14**: (1) `submit()` now uses atomic `SET NX EX` for slot acquisition, (2) `complete()` uses Lua script for atomic pop-and-set, (3) `get_all_busy_agents()` uses `SCAN` instead of blocking `KEYS`. All 20 queue tests pass. See `docs/memory/feature-flows/execution-queue.md` (EQ-H1, EQ-H2, EQ-M1 from audit report). | **HIGH** |
| ✅ | **Missing Auth on Lifecycle Endpoints** | **Fixed 2026-01-21**: Verified endpoints `start_agent` (line 316), `stop_agent` (line 343), and `get_logs` (line 368) all use `AuthorizedAgentByName` dependency which calls `db.can_user_access_agent()`. See `dependencies.py:228-255` (AL-H1, AL-H2). | **HIGH** |
| ✅ | **Container Security Inconsistency** | **Fixed 2026-01-14**: Added `RESTRICTED_CAPABILITIES` and `FULL_CAPABILITIES` constants in `lifecycle.py:31-49`. Both `crud.py` and `lifecycle.py` now use these constants with consistent security: always `cap_drop=['ALL']`, always `apparmor:docker-default`, always `tmpfs noexec,nosuid`. See `lifecycle.py:343-368`, `crud.py:462-464` (AL-H3). | **HIGH** |
| ✅ | **Duplicate Schedule Execution** | **Fixed 2026-01-13**: Implemented dedicated scheduler service with Redis distributed locking. See `src/scheduler/`, `docs/memory/feature-flows/scheduler-service.md`. | **HIGH** |
| ✅ | **Process Engine: Template Variables Not Substituted** | **Fixed 2026-01-23**: Added `ExpressionEvaluator` to `HumanApprovalHandler`. `_evaluate_template()` method creates `EvaluationContext` from step context and calls `evaluate()` on `title` and `description` before creating `ApprovalRequest`. See `human_approval.py:106-126, 186-188`. Unit tests added in `test_approval_handler.py`. | **HIGH** |
| ✅ | **Shared Folders: Template Config Not Extracted** | **Fixed 2026-01-23**: Added `shared_folders` extraction from `template.yaml` (lines 173-179) and DB upsert before container creation (lines 394-404). Now templates with `shared_folders: expose: true` correctly get `/shared-out/` mounted. See `crud.py:92,173-179,394-404`. Impacts 13 templates: `dd-*`, `demo-researcher`, `demo-analyst`. | **HIGH** |
| ✅ | Executions 404 for Non-Existent Agent | **Verified 2026-01-27**: Already fixed. `AuthorizedAgent` dependency validates agent existence via `db.get_agent_owner()` and returns 404 "Agent not found" for non-existent agents. See `dependencies.py:198-202`. | LOW |
| ✅ | Test Client Headers Bug | **Fixed 2026-01-27**: Added header merging to `AsyncTrinityApiClient` methods (get, post, put, delete) matching sync client pattern. Now pops `headers` from kwargs and merges with auth headers. See `tests/utils/api_client.py:208-280`. | LOW |
| ✅ | Emergency Stop Test Timeout | **Fixed 2026-01-27**: Added `system_prefix` query parameter to `POST /api/ops/emergency-stop` endpoint. Test now uses `system_prefix=nonexistent-test-prefix-xyz` to verify structure without stopping agents. Test completes in 0.25s (was timing out). See `routers/ops.py:607-682`, `tests/test_ops.py:367-391`. | LOW |
| ✅ | Context % Calculation Bug | **Fixed 2025-12-12**: Main bug was in agent_server/routers/chat.py incorrectly summing input_tokens + cache_creation_tokens + cache_read_tokens, causing >100% display (130%, 289%). cache_creation and cache_read are billing SUBSETS, not additional tokens. Now uses metadata.input_tokens directly (authoritative total from modelUsage). Also fixed in scheduler_service.py (2 locations, 2025-12-06) and claude_code.py logging. | HIGH |
| ✅ | Template Detail Endpoint 404 | **Fixed 2025-12-22**: `GET /api/templates/{id}` returned 404 for GitHub templates like `github:org/repo`. Root cause: The `/` in the template ID was interpreted as path separator. Fix: Changed route from `{template_id}` to `{template_id:path}` to capture full path including slashes. | MEDIUM |
| ✅ | .env Template Endpoint Bug | **Verified 2025-12-22**: Endpoint works correctly. Code at lines 110-130 already handles both string credentials (GitHub templates) and dict credentials (local templates). Tested all GitHub templates + local templates - all pass. | MEDIUM |

### Phase 12: Agent Perception & Attention (Cognitive Patterns)
⏳ **Pending** — *Emergent coordination via event-driven cognition*

| Status | Item | Description | Priority |
|--------|------|-------------|----------|
| ⏳ | **Event Bus Infrastructure** | Platform-wide pub/sub system for agent event broadcasting and subscription | HIGH |
| ⏳ | Event Types & Schema | Define standard event types (task_completed, anomaly_detected, resource_available, attention_required) | HIGH |
| ⏳ | Agent Event Subscriptions | Agents declare interest in event types via template.yaml or runtime API | MEDIUM |
| ⏳ | Event Persistence & Replay | Store events for late-joining agents and debugging | MEDIUM |
| ⏳ | **Attention Amplification Pattern** | Cognitive pattern: agents select salient events from perception and amplify to others | HIGH |
| ⏳ | Salience Scoring | Agents assign importance scores to perceived events based on relevance to their goals | MEDIUM |
| ⏳ | Broadcast Amplification | High-salience events re-broadcast with amplification metadata (source_agent, salience_score, reasoning) | MEDIUM |
| ⏳ | Attention Cascade Detection | Platform detects when multiple agents amplify same event (emergent consensus) | LOW |
| ⏳ | Attention Dashboard | Visualize event flow and amplification patterns in Collaboration Dashboard | LOW |

**Cognitive Pattern: Attention Amplification**
```
1. Agent perceives events from subscribed channels
2. Agent evaluates salience: "Does this require attention?"
3. High-salience events are re-broadcast with amplification:
   {
     "type": "attention_required",
     "original_event": {...},
     "amplified_by": "agent-name",
     "salience_score": 0.92,
     "reasoning": "Anomaly in data pipeline may affect downstream agents"
   }
4. Other agents see amplified events with social proof
5. Platform tracks amplification cascades for emergent coordination
```

## Backlog

Items not yet scheduled. Will be prioritized as needed.

| Priority | Item | Requirement |
|----------|------|-------------|
| ✅ | ~~**Async MCP Chat Commands**~~ | **Completed 2026-01-30**: `async=true` parameter on `chat_with_agent` MCP tool. Returns execution_id immediately; poll `/api/agents/{name}/executions/{id}` for results. |
| Low | **Create Schedule from Task** | UX: Add icon in Tasks tab to create schedule from execution - switches to Schedules tab with message pre-filled |
| **High** | **Horizontal Agent Scalability** | 13.1 - Agent pools with multiple instances for parallel workloads |
| **High** | **Event Bus Infrastructure** | 13.2 - Platform-wide pub/sub for agent event broadcasting/subscription |
| **High** | **Event Handlers & Reactions** | 13.3 - Automatic agent reactions to events from permitted agents |
| **High** | **Attention Amplification Pattern** | Phase 12 - Cognitive pattern for salience-based event amplification |
| Medium | **Process Designer UI** | 14.16 - Visual drag-and-drop process builder |
| Medium | **SOC-2/ISO Compliance Methodology** | 15.* - Extend dev-methodology-template for audit-ready practices |
| Low | Task DAG Graph Visualization | 9.8 - Visual dependency graph (Vue Flow) - backend ready, UI nice-to-have |
| Medium | Kubernetes deployment scripts | 10.3 Kubernetes Deployment |
| Medium | Helm charts | 10.3 Kubernetes Deployment |
| Low | Automated testing pipeline | Non-functional |
| Low | Performance monitoring dashboard | Non-functional |
| Low | Agent resource usage alerts | Non-functional |
| **High** | **Claude Code Hooks for State Persistence** | Use `.claude/hooks/` (`Stop`, `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`) to persist agent work state before context compaction. Enables work to survive context window resets. Inspired by Gastown. |
| Medium | **Convoy-like Work Bundles** | Group related tasks/executions into trackable units for multi-agent coordination. Track multi-agent projects as single unit. Inspired by Gastown. |
| Medium | **Ephemeral Agent Spawning** | Let System Agent spawn temporary worker agents on-demand (create → run task → auto-cleanup). No pre-creation required. Inspired by Gastown. |
| Low | **Ready Work Discovery MCP Tool** | `find_ready_work()` tool to discover unblocked tasks across fleet. System Agent can identify what can be worked on next. Inspired by Gastown. |
| **High** | **Bug: Live Execution Logs on Production** | SSE streaming for live execution logs not working on production. Tasks tab → Execution Detail page loads but no log entries appear. Needs investigation. |
| **High** | **Git Worktrees for Task Isolation** | Each execution (Tasks tab) gets its own git worktree/branch. Enables parallel executions without interference. Human decides: merge to main or discard. Worktrees become audit trail. Significant architecture change - needs detailed design. |
| **High** | **MCP as Primary Integration Point** | Local Claude Code agents connect to Trinity via MCP, pull default skills, become Trinity-compatible with minimal setup. MCP becomes single integration point for local→remote workflow. Goal: just add MCP connection, do rest via MCP tools. |
| Medium | **Agent Org Structures (Hierarchy)** | Parent-child agent relationships. Parents can: delegate tasks, start/stop/delete, configure children. Parents cannot: access child credentials. Single-parent tree. Builds on current permissions model. Visual grouping on Dashboard. |
| Medium | **Any Repo / Empty Agent Creation** | Two new creation modes: (1) Create agent from any GitHub repo (clone as template OR work in-place), (2) Create empty Trinity-compatible agent with minimal scaffolding. |
| Medium | **Empty Agent → GitHub Safety** | Block "Initialize GitHub" to existing repos when agent workspace is empty. Only allow initialization to NEW repos. Prevents accidental repo wipe. |
| Medium | **Centralized MCP Server Management** | UI and MCP tools to manage MCP server connections for any agent. Add/remove MCP servers without editing templates. Design TBD - per-agent config vs platform-level library. |
| ✅ | ~~**Template MCP Server Injection**~~ | **Fixed 2026-02-05**: `.mcp.json.template` files now auto-processed during agent creation. `generate_credential_files()` in `template_service.py` checks for `.mcp.json.template` as fallback, substitutes `${VAR}` and `${VAR:-default}` placeholders with credential values. SMARTS trading pipeline now fully automated. |
| **High** | **SMARTS Trading Pipeline DB Schema** | **Identified 2026-02-05**: Cascade test revealed agents write to local container files instead of Supabase `integration_context`. Need schema design specifically for 8 SMARTS trading agents: (1) **market-regime** → `market_regime` context (VIX, SPY trend, breadth), (2) **news-sentiment** → `news_sentiment` per symbol, (3) **discovery** → `scanner_opportunity` with scores/signals, (4) **analysis** → `analysis` with scenarios/EV/stance, (5) **decision** → `decision` with action/size/stops, (6) **execution** → `execution` with order status, (7) **portfolio-manager** → `pm_directive` for blocks/alerts, (8) **feedback** → `feedback_metrics` with win rate/profit factor. Schema must support: TTL expiration, symbol filtering, confidence thresholds, pipeline stage querying. Update agent CLAUDE.md files to use Supabase MCP `upsert_context`/`query_context` tools. |
| Low | **GitHub Issues for Roadmap** | Use GitHub Issues instead of roadmap.md for Trinity platform development tracking. Migrate existing items when implemented. |
| Low | **Agent History in GitHub** | Store agent history (chat transcripts, execution logs, config) in git repo. Repository becomes source of truth. History survives agent deletion. Design open. |

## Decision Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2026-01-30 | Feature Requests Batch Added to Backlog | Added 10 items from planning session: (1) **Bug: Live logs** - HIGH, broken in production; (2) **Git worktrees** - HIGH, task isolation via branches, audit trail; (3) **MCP as primary integration** - HIGH, local agents connect via MCP, pull skills, minimal setup; (4) **Agent org structures** - MEDIUM, parent-child hierarchy; (5) **Any repo/empty agent** - MEDIUM, flexible creation modes; (6) **GitHub safety** - MEDIUM, prevent empty agent wiping repos; (7) **MCP server management** - MEDIUM, centralized UI; (8) **GitHub issues** - LOW, roadmap tracking; (9) **History in GitHub** - LOW, repo as source of truth. Theme: GitHub-centric workflow + MCP-first experience. |
| 2026-01-27 | Gastown-Inspired Features Added to Backlog | After analyzing Gastown (Steve Yegge's multi-agent CLI tool), identified 4 features to adopt: (1) Claude Code Hooks for state persistence (HIGH - enables work to survive context compaction), (2) Convoy-like work bundles (MEDIUM - track multi-agent projects as units), (3) Ephemeral agent spawning (MEDIUM - on-demand workers), (4) Ready work discovery (LOW - find unblocked tasks). See `docs/research/gastown-comparison.md`. |
| 2026-01-16 | Process Engine Completed (Phase 14) | Implemented full BPMN-inspired Process Engine with 15 sprints: YAML definitions, execution engine with 6 step handlers, human approvals, parallel execution, sub-processes, analytics/cost tracking, EMI roles, templates. Deferred Event Bus - using direct WebSocket broadcasting instead. Visual designer deferred (YAML editor with preview sufficient for now). See `docs/PROCESS_DRIVEN_PLATFORM/` and `docs/memory/feature-flows/process-engine/`. |
| 2026-01-09 | Compliance-Ready Development Methodology (Phase 15) | Extend `dev-methodology-template/` to produce SOC-2 and ISO 27001-compatible development artifacts. The existing methodology (slash commands, memory files, security-check, changelog) maps naturally to compliance controls. Formalizing this enables enterprise adoption and audit-ready AI development practices. |
| 2026-01-06 | Process-Driven Multi-Agent Vision | Evolution from agent management to business process orchestration. Processes define agents (not vice versa). RACI matrix for role assignment. System Agent as primary interface for design/test/monitor. Human-in-the-loop improvement cycles. See `docs/PROCESS_DRIVEN_PLATFORM/PROCESS_DRIVEN_AGENTS.md`. |
| 2026-01-06 | Event Bus with Permission-Gated Subscriptions | Agents subscribe to events from permitted agents only (reuses agent_permissions). Event handlers trigger agent execution like schedules but event-driven. Foundation for process-driven systems. |
| 2026-01-06 | Horizontal Agent Scalability | Agent pools with N instances for parallel task processing. Load balancing, auto-scaling, shared credentials. Enables high-throughput workflows. |
| 2025-12-22 | Parallel Headless Execution (12.1) | Two execution modes: Sequential Chat (maintains context with --continue) and Parallel Task (stateless, no lock). Enables orchestrators to spawn N parallel worker tasks. Based on Claude Code headless mode research. |
| 2025-12-20 | Internal System Agent (11.1) | Platform needs a privileged orchestrator that auto-deploys on startup, executes system-level user requests, and cannot be deleted. Enables unified multi-agent coordination. |
| 2025-12-08 | Deprioritize Task DAG Graph Viz | Backend workplan system complete; text-based UI sufficient for now; graph viz is nice-to-have |
| 2025-12-05 | Deep Agent positioning | Trinity = "Four Pillars of Deep Agency" platform. Pillar I (Explicit Planning) is the priority gap. |
| 2025-11-26 | Docker as source of truth | Eliminates in-memory registry issues with multiple workers |
| 2025-11-27 | SQLite + Redis hybrid | SQLite for relations, Redis for secrets - survives restarts |
| 2025-11-27 | No external agent UI ports | Security - all access via authenticated backend API |
| 2025-11-28 | Auth0 domain restriction | Enterprise security - @ability.ai only |
